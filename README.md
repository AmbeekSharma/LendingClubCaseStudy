# Lending Club Case
> This assignment provides insight into solving real business problems using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with a focus on risk analytics in banking and financial services. It simulates the decision-making process for a consumer finance company that lends various loans to urban customers. The company faces two risks: losing business by rejecting loans for likely payers or suffering financial loss from defaulting borrowers. The dataset contains information on past loan applicants, and the goal is to identify patterns that predict default tendencies, guiding decisions like loan denial, adjusted amounts, or higher interest rates for risky applicants.

## General Information
**Objective**

The company, an online loan marketplace, facilitates personal and business loans. Its primary financial risk is lending to "risky" applicants who may default, leading to credit lossâ€”the financial loss incurred when borrowers fail to repay. Customers labeled as 'charged-off' are considered defaulters. The goal of this case study is to identify risky applicants through EDA, enabling the company to minimize credit losses. By understanding the key factors driving loan defaults, the company can improve its risk assessment and loan portfolio management.
